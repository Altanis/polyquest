# poly quest

each player has a host planet. there exist three other entities:
- planets (ATTACK for exp)
- comets (collide with for health, attacking gives extra health)
- stars (collide with for energy)

all have their own health. attacking does more dmg than collision, and killing one gives you some exp.

planets act as bases where players are invincible, but leaving a planet leaves it susceptible to attack. if the planet dies, itll take 5min to regenerate (leaving player with no base). players cant attack if theyre on their own planet.

planets: resembles earth. glows red if its not yours, glows green if it is yours.
stars: according to hr diagram (blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, where blue is highest energy and red is lowest)
comets: polygonal shape with cometary ectoplasmic thing around it
